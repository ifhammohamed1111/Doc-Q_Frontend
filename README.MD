## Guidelines

### Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To ensure a smooth and collaborative experience for everyone, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Project**\
Before contributing, take the time to understand the project's purpose, goals, and existing codebase. Familiarize yourself with the project's architecture, coding standards, and conventions.

2. **Follow Code Style and Conventions**\
Maintain consistency with existing code by following the established coding style and conventions. Use meaningful variable names, write clear and concise comments, and adhere to the project's formatting guidelines.

3. **Respect the License**\
Ensure that your contributions comply with the project's license. If you're introducing new dependencies or code that may affect licensing, consult with the maintainers to ensure compatibility.

4. **Create Separate Branches**\
For each new feature, bug fix, or improvement, create a separate branch from the main development branch. Name your branches descriptively and prefix them with a relevant identifier (e.g., feature/, bugfix/, enhancement/).

5. **Commit Guidelines**\
Commit your changes in logical, atomic units with clear and descriptive commit messages. Each commit should represent a single coherent change. Reference related issues or pull requests in your commit messages using appropriate keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").

6. **Write Tests**\
Whenever possible, accompany your code contributions with appropriate tests. Write unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. Run existing tests before submitting your changes to avoid regressions.

7. **Document Your Changes**\
Document any new features, APIs, or significant changes introduced by your contributions. Update existing documentation as necessary to reflect changes in functionality or behavior. Provide clear and comprehensive explanations to help users and other contributors understand your changes.

8. **Review and Discuss**\
Before submitting a pull request, review your code thoroughly to catch any errors or oversights. Seek feedback from other contributors or maintainers, and be open to constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement. Engage in discussions to address any concerns or questions raised during the review process.

9. **Test Locally**\
Test your changes locally to ensure they function as expected in different environments and scenarios. Verify that your code integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase and does not introduce any unintended side effects or performance issues.

10. **Submit Pull Requests**\
When you're confident in your changes, submit a pull request to merge your branch into the main development branch. Provide a clear and informative title and description for your pull request, summarizing the purpose and scope of your changes. Include relevant context, such as links to related issues or discussions.

11. **Be Patient and Respectful**\
Be patient throughout the contribution process, as it may take time for your pull requests to be reviewed and merged. Respect the decisions of the project maintainers and other contributors, and be willing to iterate on your changes based on feedback and suggestions.

12. **Acknowledge Contributors**\
Recognize and acknowledge the contributions of others, whether through code reviews, comments, or collaboration on pull requests. Show appreciation for their efforts and contributions to the project.

**By following these guidelines, you can contribute effectively to the project while fostering a positive and collaborative community environment. Thank you for your contributions!**
